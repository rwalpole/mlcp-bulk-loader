This Bulk Loader extends MarkLogic Content Pump (MLCP) to bulk load multiple directories of data into a running instance of MarkLogic NoSQL Database. It takes either a text input file which contains a list of directory paths or a directory name from which it then attempts to load the sub-directories contained within. Which method to use depends on the location of your data and whether you want to be highly selective or not.
